# scavengerhunt
Mobile and game version of Stakeout

Admin creates games, invites players, builds teams and enters treasures.

Game alerts players when new treasures are found.

Players can "vote" on legitimacy of others' "treasures" ("observations").

"Admin" can override above votes to mediate disputes. Like the "admin" in a deathpool.
